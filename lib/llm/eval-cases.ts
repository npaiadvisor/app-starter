/**
 * Phase 2E — curated eval cases (synthetic, no PII).
 *
 * Each case carries the agent input payload plus the Phase 1 rubric machinery:
 * a `binaryChecks` array (deterministic 6-kind battery) and `rubric` questions
 * (binary "did this violate?" prompts for the LLM judge). All names/orgs here
 * are fictional — the repo may be public, and the real 1261-row Phase 1 dataset
 * (real prospect PII) stays in Google Sheets. `scripts/seed-eval-cases.ts`
 * loads these by default and can optionally pull the historical Sheet rows.
 *
 * These cases are the live-runner dataset. The deterministic judge logic is
 * unit-tested separately (lib/llm/__tests__/judge.test.ts) with inline vectors;
 * here the checks encode per-scenario expectations the model output must meet.
